At Strike Zone Bowling Alley, we provide a fun and exciting experience for bowlers of all ages through lane rentals. 
To manage our operations efficiently, comply with regulations, and understand who our main clientele is, 
we need to keep detailed electronic records of all lane reservations. 
This includes customer details, reservation times, lane numbers, and customer age.

Answer: Yes, we need both the start time and end time for each lane reservation.
There is also a minimum amount of 30 minutes required.

Answer: We have 20 lanes available for reservations.

Question: What hours are you open? 
Answer: We are open Sunday through Friday from 9 - 11
